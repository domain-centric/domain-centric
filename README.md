# Domain Centric

We believe that code should be:
-	Easy to read
-	Easy to understand
-	Easy to change, extend, and maintain

As a consequence we believe that:
-	The domain layer should have our primary focus.
-	The domain layer should have no direct dependencies with specific technologies such as frameworks, user interfaces, web services or databases, so that:
  - The domain layer is not soiled with outer layer concerns
  - The domain layer is easy to test
  - The technology is relatively easy to swap out with a different technology.
-	Frameworks and code generation are good tools to use in the outside layers such as the user interface layer and the infrastructure layer.

We are big fans of:
-	[Domain driven design](https://www.google.com/search?q=domain+driven+design)
-	[Clean code](https://www.google.com/search?q=clean+code)
-	[Clean architecture](https://www.google.com/search?q=clean+architecture)
-	[Naked object design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects)
