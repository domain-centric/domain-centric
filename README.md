# Domain Centric

Believing that code should be:
-	Easy to read
-	Easy to understand
-	Easy to change, extend, and maintain

<br>

As a consequence believing that:
-   Layering helps to distinguish and distribute the responsibilities of our application
-	Attributes and behaviour are captured in domain objects in the domain layer. This is the center and most important part of our application.
-	The domain layer should have no direct dependencies with specific technologies such as frameworks, user interfaces, web services or databases, so that:
    - The domain layer is not soiled with outer layer responsibilities
    - The domain layer is easy to test
    - The technology in the outside layers are relatively easy to change out with a different technology.
-	Frameworks and code generation are good tools to use in the outside layers such as the user interface layer and the infrastructure layer.
